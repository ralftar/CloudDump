**Keep a copy of your cloud data somewhere you control.**

The cloud is just someone else's computer. CloudDump pulls your persistent
data — S3 buckets, Azure Blob Storage, PostgreSQL databases — down to
on-premises storage, another cloud, or wherever you want. On a schedule,
unattended, with email notifications when things succeed or fail.

CloudDump is **not** a backup system. There is no rotation, no versioning,
no retention policies. It gives you a current-state copy of your data,
synced on a cron schedule. What you do with that copy — feed it into
Restic, Borg, Veeam, tape, a RAID array in your basement — is up to you.

## Why

You store data in S3 or Azure. Your databases run in the cloud. That's
fine — until a provider has an outage, a misconfigured IAM policy deletes
your bucket, or you just want to sleep better knowing there's a copy on
hardware you own.

CloudDump runs as a single Docker container. Point it at your cloud
resources, tell it when to sync, and forget about it. If something breaks,
you get an email. Consider setting up a dead-man switch (e.g.
[Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io)) that alerts you when expected
emails *stop arriving* — a silent failure is worse than a loud one.

## Disaster recovery

CloudDump can be a key component in your disaster recovery plan. Critically,
CloudDump *pulls* data from the cloud — the cloud provider has no knowledge
of your local copy. This means a compromised or malfunctioning cloud
environment cannot delete, encrypt, or tamper with data it doesn't know
exists. The dependency flows one way: your backup depends on the cloud being
reachable, but the cloud has zero control over what you already have.

A typical DR setup:

1. **CloudDump syncs** your S3 buckets, Azure blobs, and databases to local
   storage on a schedule.
2. **A proper backup tool** (Restic, Borg, Veeam, etc.) snapshots the local
   copy with versioning and retention.
3. **Monitoring** — CloudDump emails you on every run. Pair this with a
   dead-man switch so you are alerted if reports stop arriving entirely.
4. **Regular restore drills** — periodically verify that you can actually
   restore from the local copy.

This gives you defense in depth: CloudDump handles the "get the data out of
the cloud" step, your backup tool handles versioning and retention, and the
dead-man switch ensures the whole pipeline is still running.

## Quick start

**1. Create a config file**

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "HOST": "myserver",
    "SMTPSERVER": "smtp.example.com",
    "SMTPPORT": "465",
    "SMTPUSER": "alerts@example.com",
    "SMTPPASS": "smtp-password",
    "MAILFROM": "alerts@example.com",
    "MAILTO": "ops@example.com, oncall@example.com"
  },
  "jobs": [
    {
      "type": "s3bucket",
      "id": "prod-assets",
      "crontab": "0 3 * * *",
      "buckets": [
        {
          "source": "s3://my-bucket",
          "destination": "/mnt/clouddump/s3",
          "aws_access_key_id": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
          "aws_secret_access_key": "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY",
          "aws_region": "eu-west-1"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Run the container**

```sh
docker run -d --restart always \
  --name clouddump \
  --mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/config.json,target=/config/config.json,readonly \
  --volume /backup:/mnt/clouddump \
  ghcr.io/ralftar/clouddump:latest
```

That's it. CloudDump will sync your S3 bucket to `/backup/s3` every day at
03:00 and email you the result.

## Supported sources

| Source | Job type | Tool used | Auth |
|--------|----------|-----------|------|
| AWS S3 | `s3bucket` | AWS CLI | Access key + secret |
| S3-compatible (MinIO, etc.) | `s3bucket` | AWS CLI | Access key + secret + `endpoint_url` |
| Azure Blob Storage | `azstorage` | AzCopy | SAS token in source URL |
| PostgreSQL | `pgsql` | pg_dump / psql | Host, port, user, password |

## Features

- **Cron scheduling** — standard 5-field cron patterns (`0 3 * * *`, `*/15 * * * *`)
- **Catch-up execution** — if a scheduled run is missed because another job is
  still running, it fires as soon as the slot opens (within a 60-minute window)
- **Retry & timeout** — configurable per job (default: 3 attempts, 1-week timeout)
- **Email reports** — success/failure notifications with log file attached
- **Mount support** — SSH (`sshfs`) and SMB (`smbnetfs`) destinations without
  elevated privileges
- **Credential redaction** — passwords, keys, and tokens are scrubbed from logs
  and emails automatically
- **Health check** — built-in Docker `HEALTHCHECK` via heartbeat file
- **Graceful shutdown** — SIGTERM forwarded to child processes

## Configuration reference

### Settings

| Key | Required | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `HOST` | No | Hostname shown in email subjects |
| `SMTPSERVER` | No | SMTP server (SSL, port 465) |
| `SMTPPORT` | No | SMTP port |
| `SMTPUSER` | No | SMTP username |
| `SMTPPASS` | No | SMTP password |
| `MAILFROM` | No | Sender address |
| `MAILTO` | No | Recipient address(es) — comma-separated or JSON array |
| `DEBUG` | No | Enable debug logging (`true`/`false`) |
| `mount` | No | Array of SSH/SMB mount definitions |

Email is optional. If SMTP is not configured, CloudDump runs silently.
`MAILTO` accepts multiple recipients as a comma-separated string
(`"ops@example.com, oncall@example.com"`) or a JSON array
(`["ops@example.com", "oncall@example.com"]`).

### Job fields

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | — | Unique job identifier |
| `type` | Yes | — | `s3bucket`, `azstorage`, or `pgsql` |
| `crontab` | Yes | — | 5-field cron pattern |
| `timeout` | No | `604800` (7 days) | Job timeout in seconds |
| `retries` | No | `3` | Number of attempts on failure |

Plus type-specific fields (`buckets`, `blobstorages`, `servers`) — see examples below.

### S3 bucket

```json
{
  "type": "s3bucket",
  "id": "my-s3-job",
  "crontab": "0 2 * * *",
  "buckets": [
    {
      "source": "s3://bucket-name/optional-prefix",
      "destination": "/mnt/clouddump/s3",
      "delete_destination": false,
      "aws_access_key_id": "AKIA...",
      "aws_secret_access_key": "...",
      "aws_region": "us-east-1",
      "endpoint_url": ""
    }
  ]
}
```

Set `endpoint_url` for S3-compatible storage like MinIO:

```json
"endpoint_url": "https://minio.example.com:9000"
```

### Azure Blob Storage

```json
{
  "type": "azstorage",
  "id": "my-azure-job",
  "crontab": "*/5 * * * *",
  "blobstorages": [
    {
      "source": "https://account.blob.core.windows.net/container?sv=...&sig=...",
      "destination": "/mnt/clouddump/azure",
      "delete_destination": true
    }
  ]
}
```

The source URL includes the SAS token for authentication.

### PostgreSQL

```json
{
  "type": "pgsql",
  "id": "my-pg-job",
  "crontab": "0 4 * * *",
  "servers": [
    {
      "host": "db.example.com",
      "port": 5432,
      "user": "backup_user",
      "pass": "password",
      "databases": [
        { "mydb": { "tables_included": [], "tables_excluded": ["large_logs"] } }
      ],
      "databases_excluded": ["template0", "template1"],
      "backuppath": "/mnt/clouddump/pg",
      "filenamedate": true,
      "compress": true
    }
  ]
}
```

- `databases`: explicit list with per-database table filters. If empty, all
  databases are dumped (except `databases_excluded`).
- `compress`: bzip2 compression of dump files.
- `filenamedate`: append timestamp to dump filenames.

### Mounts

```json
"mount": [
  {
    "path": "user@host:/remote/path",
    "mountpoint": "/mnt/ssh-target",
    "privkey": "/config/id_rsa"
  },
  {
    "path": "//server/share",
    "mountpoint": "/mnt/smb-target",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "pass"
  }
]
```

Mounts are set up at startup before any jobs run. Use them as backup
destinations in your job configs.

## Architecture

CloudDump is a single-process Python application in a Debian 12 container.

```
config.json ──> [Orchestrator] ──> aws s3 sync
                     │          ──> azcopy sync
                     │          ──> pg_dump / psql
                     │
                     ├── cron scheduler (check every 60s)
                     ├── sequential job execution
                     ├── signal forwarding (SIGTERM → child)
                     └── email reports (SMTPS)
```

Jobs run one at a time. If job B is scheduled while job A is still running,
job B fires as soon as A finishes (within a 60-minute catch-up window). This
keeps resource usage predictable and avoids conflicts on shared destinations.

### Bundled tools

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| AWS CLI | 2.22.19 |
| AzCopy | 10.32.1 |
| PostgreSQL client | 15 |

## Troubleshooting

**Container won't start** — Verify `config.json` is valid JSON and mounted at
`/config/config.json`. CloudDump validates all jobs at startup and logs errors
to stdout.

**Jobs not running** — Check your cron syntax. Supported: `*`, `*/N`, exact
values. Not supported: ranges (`1-5`), lists (`1,3,5`). Check container logs
for scheduling messages.

**Email not working** — CloudDump uses SMTPS (SSL on port 465). Verify the
container can reach your SMTP server. Check logs for `Failed to send email`
messages.

**Mount failures** — SSH mounts need a valid key and reachable host. SMB mounts
need FUSE support in the container runtime. Check logs for mount errors at
startup.

**Debug mode** — Set `"DEBUG": true` in settings for verbose logging.
